MESSAGE ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION PROGRAM MADE IN C#

The program interface is made using WinForms and has three input fields, the first is a set of characters
that are used when encrypting and decrypting the message. The second field is for the text that needs to be encrypted or
decrypted and the last field is the final result. At the top there are two radio buttons that decide whether the message will be encrypted 
or decrypted. And on the right is the button for triggering the encryption or decryption process.
